There are three files to execute and plot any of the experiments performed in this assignment
1.) compile.sh - Used to compile the java source code. The java file names are self explanatory. Run the required experiment by commenting in/out the corresponding java file. Present in the "src" dir.
2.) run_abagail.sh - present in the main directory. Comment in/out necessary lines to run the corresponding experiments. 
3.) Plot.py - Present in the src directory. Please note that all the experiment results are saved in "Optimization_Results" in the main dir. In order to plot a particular experiment, point plot.py to the correct file in "Optimization_Results": this can be done my modifying the path in the constructor of class in plot.py. 

The entire source code can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QgS-YrIKYAEcQ9CLf9gInhRYCBTbwBIv
